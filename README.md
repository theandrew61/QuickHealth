## Introduction
There is so much to cover about this addon! First of all, it is [i]my first Garry's Mod workshop upload[/i], hooray!

## What does it do?
It grants you 10 health when you need it. It's kind of similar to the medkit, except QuickHealth doesn't take long to restore your health.

## Features
- it's a **SWEP** that looks like a pistol
- **NO AMMO!**
- **admin spawnable** - to prevent cheating
- works *clientside*, not sure about *mutliplayer* or *TTT*
- **left click** to give yourself [i]10 health[/i] (also plays [i]power up[/i] sound effect)
- **reload** to restore all your health (also plays [i]1 UP[/i] sound effect)
- if the weapon is out and if you fall, you hear a [i]lose your powerup[/i] sound effect
